<h1> <align=center> SUM ARRAY ON HOST AND DEVICE </h3>

## AIM:

To perform vector addition on host and device.

## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:
Hardware â€“ PCs with NVIDIA GPU & CUDA NVCC
Google Colab with NVCC Compiler

## RELATED THEORETICAL CONCEPT:




## PROCEDURE:

1. Initialize the device and set the device properties.
2. Allocate memory on the host for input and output arrays.
3. Initialize input arrays with random values on the host.
4. Allocate memory on the device for input and output arrays, and copy input data from host to device.
5. Launch a CUDA kernel to perform vector addition on the device.
6. Copy output data from the device to the host and verify the results against the host's sequential vector addition. Free memory on the host and the device.
